\section{Introduction}
\quad
A pure hardware design of Galaga was implemented without the use of the NIOS-II System on Chip.
In terms of I/O, the joystick and buttons on the shield were used as user input.
The VGA was the main output given the fact that a video game was made.
While a full version of Galaga was not implemented, a majority of the key features were included such as player control, shooting, bullet hit detection, and enemy animation and movement.
